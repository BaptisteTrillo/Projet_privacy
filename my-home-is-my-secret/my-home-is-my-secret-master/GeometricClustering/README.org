* Short tutorial:
** Get the program running:
- create new eclipse project
- unzip src.zip and copy files into project folder
- add jar files to build path
- unzip input.zip into project folder
- run program (without setting program arguments: will apply clustering with k=4 on "input/centroids-utm.shp")
** After program completion:
- add generated shp files to qgis
- use column "myid" to display different clusters with different colors

* References
The following method is used to obtain clusters of size at least k:
