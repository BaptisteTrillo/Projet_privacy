# Trajectory Mining Library for Python!

The aim of this library is to provide a simple python library for researchers who like to process trajectories. This library is in the early stage and we gradually add features to it.

# example
## animal dataset
take a look at [TrajLib_Usage_Example.ipynb](./TrajLib_Usage_Example.ipynb)

## geolife dataset
we create an example code "create_geolife_features.py" [here](./create_geolife_features.py) that generates segment features and points features for Geolife dataset. This is not a full dataset and is filltered by one user.
If you need to use the full geolife dataset, please run this code on the full dataset.
